            <p>It's one of the most common and dangerous financial assumptions: "I have life insurance through my job, so my family is protected." While it's a nice employee benefit, relying on it as your only safety net is a high-stakes gamble. This coverage isn't the solid protection you think it is; it's a trap with three hidden dangers.</p>
            
            <h3>Danger #1: It's Not Portable (The Golden Handcuffs)</h3>
            <p>The most critical flaw in employer-provided life insurance is that you don't own it. Your employer does. This means the moment your employment ends—whether you quit for a better opportunity, get laid off, or retire—your coverage vanishes. </p>
            <p>This creates "golden handcuffs." You might feel tied to a job you dislike because you fear losing your insurance. If you do leave, you're forced to shop for a new policy when you're older and potentially less healthy, which means you'll pay significantly higher premiums, if you can even qualify for coverage at all.</p>

            <h3>Danger #2: It's Not Enough (The "One-Size-Fits-None" Policy)</h3>
            <p>Group policies typically offer a death benefit that is a small multiple of your salary, usually 1x or 2x your annual income. This might sound substantial, but it's dangerously inadequate for most families. </p>
            <p>Think about what that money needs to do:
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 my-4 space-y-2">
                    <li>Pay off a mortgage ($300,000+ in New Jersey).</li>
                    <li>Replace your income for 10, 15, or 20+ years.</li>
                    <li>Fund college education for your children.</li>
                    <li>Cover final expenses and medical bills.</li>
                </ul>
            A $100,000 or $200,000 payout from a group plan barely makes a dent. It provides a false sense of security while leaving your family exposed to massive financial risk.
            </p>

            <h3>Danger #3: It Can Be More Expensive Than You Think</h3>
            <p>While the basic coverage might be free, any supplemental coverage you "buy up" through your employer's plan is often purchased at group rates that may not be competitive. You are not being underwritten as an individual, so you could be subsidizing less healthy colleagues. A healthy individual can often find a private policy with more coverage for a lower premium than the cost of their "buy-up" option at work.</p>

            <h3>The Escape Plan: Own Your Own Policy</h3>
            <p>The solution is to treat your work insurance as a temporary bonus, not a core part of your financial plan. Secure a private life insurance policy that is tailored to your needs, stays with you no matter where you work, and provides a level of protection that truly secures your family's future. This is the only way to break free from the trap.</p>
