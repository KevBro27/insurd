            <p>Your life insurance policy shouldn't be a mystery document you never look at. It's a critical piece of your financial plan, and understanding it is key to ensuring it still serves its purpose. You don't need to be an expert to do a quick check-up. </p>
            <p>Here is my internal checklistâ€”the same one I use to do a quick analysis. Grab your most recent policy statement and let's spend five minutes finding out if you're truly protected or just paying a bill.</p>

            <h3>Your 5-Minute Policy Checklist</h3>
            <p>Find these key items on your policy's annual statement:</p>

            <h4>1. The Beneficiary Check (The "Who Gets the Money?" Test)</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>What to look for:</strong> The "Primary Beneficiary" and "Contingent Beneficiary" sections.
                <br />
                <strong>The question to ask:</strong> "Is this still the right person/people?" Life changes. Divorces happen, children grow up, new family members arrive. An outdated beneficiary is one of the most common and tragic mistakes, potentially sending your life's savings to an ex-spouse instead of your children.
            </p>

            <h4>2. The Coverage Check (The "Is It Enough?" Test)</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>What to look for:</strong> The "Face Amount" or "Death Benefit."
                <br />
                <strong>The question to ask:</strong> "If this check were handed to my family tomorrow, would it be enough?" Did you buy a $250,000 policy ten years ago but now have a $500,000 mortgage and two more kids? Your needs grow over time. A quick rule of thumb is 10-15x your annual income, but a real analysis is always better.
            </p>

            <h4>3. The Policy Type Check (The "What Did I Buy?" Test)</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>What to look for:</strong> The policy name. Does it say "Term," "Whole Life," or "Universal Life"?
                <br />
                <strong>The question to ask:</strong> "Does this type of policy still match my goal?" If you see "Term," check the "Term Expiration Date." If that date is approaching, you could be in for a massive price hike or lose coverage entirely. If you have "Whole Life," move to the next check.
            </p>

            <h4>4. The Cost & Value Check (The "Am I Overpaying?" Test)</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>What to look for:</strong> The "Annual Premium" and the "Cash Value."
                <br />
                <strong>The question to ask:</strong> "Am I getting a good return for my money?" Compare the premium to the death benefit. For permanent policies, look at how much your cash value has grown over the last year. If the growth is minimal and the premiums are high, your policy is likely an inefficient, outdated product. The market for insurance is competitive; there's a good chance a better deal exists today.
            </p>

            <h3>The Verdict</h3>
            <p>How did your policy stack up? If you answered "no" or "I'm not sure" to any of these questions, it's a major red flag. It doesn't mean you need to panic, but it does mean it's time for a professional, in-depth review.</p>
